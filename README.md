Transform any document into clean, usable plain text with these free
online/offline tools. Whether you're working with **Word .docx**, **PDF**s, **EPUB**s,
or **Markdown**, these converters strip away formatting while preserving
the content you need as plain text. A helpful diagnostic tool lets
you examine the underlying HTML structure of **.docx**, making it easier
to understand how your document is constructed.

Perfect for authors preparing manuscripts for **text-to-speech**
(**TTS**), publishers working with multiple formats, or anyone needing to
analyze text content. The suite includes specialized tools for TTS
preparation (including intelligent chunking that respects paragraph
boundaries), word frequency analysis, and smart paragraph
formatting - all designed to make text processing simpler and more
efficient.

The TTS chunking tool is particularly sophisticated, automatically
splitting text into optimal-sized segments between 1000 and 5000
characters - *customize the length to match your specific TTS
requirements* - while ensuring chunks only break at natural paragraph
endings.

Everything works right in your browser - no software to install, no
sign-up required, and you can use it both online and offline
(*by downloading and unzipping from Github*).
